This is new branch file. 
After creating file this branch will be pulled to another branch. 
A Git branch is a lightweight, movable pointer to a specific commit in the repository.
It allows you to diverge from the main line of development and continue to work on a separate version of the project without affecting the main branch. 
This feature is particularly useful for managing different features, bug fixes, or experiments in isolation.
A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch into another branch in a Git repository. 
Typically, pull requests are used in collaborative workflows where multiple developers work on different features or fixes in separate branches. 
A pull request allows the team to review and discuss the proposed changes before they are merged into the main branch.
Jenkins is a free, open-source tool that helps developers automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. 
It is written in Java and runs on the Java platform. By using Jenkins, we can make a continuous integration of projects(jobs) or end-to-end automation.
