This is new branch file. 
After creating file this branch will be pulled to another branch. 
A Git branch is a lightweight, movable pointer to a specific commit in the repository.
It allows you to diverge from the main line of development and continue to work on a separate version of the project without affecting the main branch. 
This feature is particularly useful for managing different features, bug fixes, or experiments in isolation.
